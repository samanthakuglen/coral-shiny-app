                 Methods for data collection: Submersible temperature loggers (Tidbit, Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne MA) were used to measure benthic temperature at nine coastal reef and two island sites in the Santa Barbara Channel, CA. 
                 At each site, two temperature loggers were secured to the seafloor at a depth of 7 m (MLLW). Each logger was programmed to record ambient temperature at an interval of 30 minutes. Note that the two loggers were staggered by 15 minutes so the final records reflect a temperature measurement every 15 minutes. The loggers were retrieved and replaced bi-annually, in the early summer and early winter. 
                 
                 Purpose of the app:
                 Giant kelp forests are home to a wide range of organisms, however, abiotic factors, such as temperature, may affect species populations and biological processes on a scale of hours to years. Furthermore, marine heatwaves (MHWs) are predicted to increase drastically in frequency, duration, range, and intensity due to anthropogenic climate change. Studies have shown that MHWs can have vast consequences, including impacts on species abundances, biogeographic range shifts, physiology, and reduced fisheries landings. In order to help local researchers and stakeholders understand temporal and spatial patterns of oceanic temperatures, we have created this app for easy SBC-LTER temperature data visualization.
